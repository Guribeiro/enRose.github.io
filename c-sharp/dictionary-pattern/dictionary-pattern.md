## The Single Page Application Era

I remember back in around 2011 there was this new way of building websites call SPA started to gaine significant amount of attention among web community. With SPA we give the website everything it needs from the get-go so there is no round-trip between browser and server, website has enough state that to satisfy user interaction, offline interactivity and responsiveness.

The result is a much pleasant user experience as there is no lagging. However, the biggest motivation in my opinion is to off-load as much as computation to the client as possible therefore cut down the cost of running in the cloud.



as the rise of Javascript framework such as AngularJs[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS] among web community.
